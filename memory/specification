Here is an example of a simple "Hello World" console app written in C#:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
        }
    }
}
```

To run the program, you should follow these steps:

1. Save the program. It's common to save the file with a `.cs` file extension.
2. Compile the program by using the C# compiler (csc.exe) included in the .NET Framework. You can do this from a command prompt.
3. Run the program by typing the name of the executable file at the command prompt.

If you're running a basic text editor and command line, the process might look something like this:

1. Write your code in a text editor and save as HelloWorld.cs.
2. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved your HelloWorld.cs file.
3. Type `csc HelloWorld.cs` and press Enter to compile your code.
4. Now run it by typing `HelloWorld` and pressing Enter (Windows) or `./HelloWorld` (Linux/UNIX).
5. You should see `"Hello, world!"` output to the console.

Note: If a 'csc' is not recognized as an internal or external command error occurs, you must set the path for the C# compiler (csc.exe) in your system's Environment Variable.
