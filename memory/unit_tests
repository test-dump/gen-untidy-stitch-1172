Another way to create a console app in C# is by using Visual Studio, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. Here is how you can do it:

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. On the top menu, select `File > New > Project`.
3. In the `Create a new project` dialog box, select `Console App (.NET Core)` then `Next`.
4. In the `Configure your new project` dialog box, type `HelloWorld` in the `Project name` field and then select `Create`.
5. In the editor, replace the contents of the Program.cs file with the following code and save the file.

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
        }
    }
}
```

To run the program, select `Debug > Start Debugging` from the top menu, or simply press `F5`. `Hello, World!` is displayed in the console window.
