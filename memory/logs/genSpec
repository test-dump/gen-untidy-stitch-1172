Save the program. It's common to save the file with a `.cs` file extension.\n2. Compile the program by using the C# compiler (csc.exe) included in the .NET Framework. You can do this from a command prompt.\n3. Run the program by typing the name of the executable file at the command prompt.\n\nIf you're running a basic text editor and command line, the process might look something like this:\n\n1. Write your code in a text editor and save as HelloWorld.cs.\n2. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved your HelloWorld.cs file.\n3. Type `csc HelloWorld.cs` and press Enter to compile your code.\n4. Now run it by typing `HelloWorld` and pressing Enter (Windows) or `./HelloWorld` (Linux/UNIX).\n5. You should see `\"Hello, world!\"` output to the console.\n\nNote: If a 'csc' is not recognized as an internal or external command error occurs, you must set the path for the C# compiler (csc.exe) in your system's Environment Variable."}]
