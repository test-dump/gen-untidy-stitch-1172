You're asking for unit tests, but it seems you inserted instructions. However, regarding the unit test of "Hello, World!" app in C#, refer to the following.

Given the simple nature of a `Console.WriteLine` statement, it's not typically something you would write a unit test for. However, if we had a method that returns a string, then it's pretty simple:

Here is a slightly modified version of the console application:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(HelloWorldMessage());
        }

        public static string HelloWorldMessage()
        {
            return "Hello, world!";
        }
    }
}
```

And here is a unit test to assert the `HelloWorldMessage` method returns `"Hello, world!"`:

```csharp
using Xunit;
using HelloWorld;

namespace HelloWorld.Tests
{
    public class ProgramTests
    {
        [Fact]
        public void HelloWorldMessage_ReturnsCorrectMessage()
        {
            Assert.Equal("Hello, world!", Program.HelloWorldMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This test uses xUnit.net which is a free, open-source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework.
